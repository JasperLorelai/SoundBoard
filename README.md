# Minecraft Soundboard
## How To Setup:
This configuration file requires the plugin [**MagicSpells**](https://github.com/TheComputerGeek2/MagicSpells/releases) to run. Note that the 1.0 version of the Soundboard only includes sounds up to 1.12.2. That Minecraft version is only supported by **MagicSpells versions below 4.0, which require [EffectLib](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/effectlib/files) as well**. The 1.0 version works on Minecraft versions 1.8.x-1.12.2, but you obviously can't play 1.12.x sounds on versions below. **Soundboard versions above 1.0 support MagicSpells 4.0+**.

Download the configuration file [**here**](https://github.com/JasperLorelai/minecraft-soundboard/releases) and place the file in your MagicSpells plugin folder, then reload the plugin. To open use one of following commands: **/soundboard**, **/sounds** or **/sb**. To grant other players access to the commannd, give them the permission **magicspells.cast.\***

In the GUI you can search for sounds to check their sound names or select it to play it. You can modify pitch and volume and try what it sounds like with your configuration. Once you think the sound is good enough you can click the paper item to paste the current sound configuration in chat where you can just copy it with by first selecting it with `[Ctrl] + [A]`, copying it with `[Ctrl] + [C]`, and pasting it in a configuration with `[Ctrl] + [V]`.
